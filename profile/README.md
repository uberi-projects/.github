The University of Belize Environmental Research Institute (UB-ERI), founded in 2010, was established to strengthen local capacity in environmental research and monitoring. Our team conducts research, training and community engagement, providing data and insights for policymakers, conservationists, and organisations to effectively manage and protect Belize’s natural resources.
